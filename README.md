# Volume Control C#
A Godot control node that allows bus volume adjustment through a slider, and muting through a check box.

It automatically detects your audio buses and set it's check box text to reflect the one you tell it to act on.

Because it's a C# asset, the project must be rebuilt before the node can be used.
It also lives in the `Hedgestock` namespace to avoid clashes.
